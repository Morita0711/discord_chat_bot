FAQ:



What happens if the other party involved does not complete their end of the agreement? 

* Any funds sent to TeaParty are returned to the sender and the order is automatically posted back onto the marketplace.  Alternatively, if the poster of the trade wishes, any funds they have sent can remain in the escrow wallet until a new buyer accepts the deal and sends their side of the transaction.  This option minimizes the inconvenience when a trade falls through.



How do I obtain GRAMS to begin trading. 

* Trading for GRAMS / Purchasing GRAMS on the TeaParty app has no transaction fee costs. 



What does it cost to trade? (Better wording here)

* The only fee TeaParty collects is the transaction fee when a trade is completed, the details of which can be found <here> [hyperlink to fee page].  The only other fee paid is whatever gas fees are applicable for the network used.  There is never any withdrawal fee paid to TeaParty.


What makes the TeaParty platform different from a CEX or DEX? 

* Unlike existing CEX and DEX setups, TeaParty does not gather your funds into large liquidity pools.  We do not believe that we have any right to invest or speculate with your money in an attempt to increase our own profits.  In addition, no large liquidity pools means no juicy target for bad actors.



Why should I trust TeaParty as opposed to the more traditional CEX or DEX exchanges?

* You shouldn't, and thatâ€™s the best part. Transparency, absolute minimum transaction/hold times, and by design. By design, TeaParty minimizes the possible losses that could incur if a bad actor were to take control of the platform. We only have a window of two hours, where the traditional CEX/DEX has a window of years +. 

* Because your funds remain in your private wallet until the trade is initiated, and then are sent to your new private wallet. By design, TeaParty minimizes any possible losses from bad actors should they manage to compromise the platform by keeping the time your coins are actually held on it to minutes or hours, rather than days or weeks.  There is also zero chance of your funds being lost through poor investment choices on our part.
